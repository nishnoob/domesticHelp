# Domestic Help WebApp

This website was built with the idea of helping families reach the household help they require. A household help could vary all the way from a maid to an electrician or a carpenter and in this world getting in touch with a good one for the job is a tough affair. This website solves this by providing the user with information about the help they require.

This website has been based on the idea of the popular website called ‘Just Dial’. The user gets provided by the information of the help they need and along with that the review of their customers and ratings.
